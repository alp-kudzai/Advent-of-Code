create a global container for all paths
Get the start and end point
~create a list of visited
def helper(visited,source,dest):
    ~append the start to visited (no need to visit again)
    ~create a queue for all node connected to start
    ~pop the first item of the queue(outer_queue)
    ~check if its the end node (final destination)
        ~if its the end node, append to visited & return visited
        ~else check what nodes connect to dest(list), remove all visited nodes, if any left, continue
            ~dest becomes new_source

            ~pop the first off, thats the new dest
